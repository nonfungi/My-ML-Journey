Section 4: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are a special set of scalars and vectors associated with a linear transformation. They are fundamental to understanding matrix transformations and have widespread applications in machine learning.

Intuitive Definition
For a given square matrix A, an eigenvector is a non-zero vector v that, when the transformation A is applied to it, does not change its direction. It only gets stretched, shrunk, or flipped.

The eigenvalue, denoted by λ, is the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.

Mathematical Formulation
The relationship is formally defined by the equation:
$$ A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v} $$
Where:

A is an n×n square matrix.

v is a non-zero n×1 column vector (the eigenvector).

λ is a scalar (the eigenvalue).

To find the eigenvalues, we can rewrite the equation as:
$$ (A - \lambda I)\mathbf{v} = 0 $$
For this equation to have a non-zero solution for v, the matrix (A−λI) must be singular, which means its determinant must be zero:
$$ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 $$
This is called the characteristic equation. Solving it for λ gives us the eigenvalues. Once we have the eigenvalues, we can plug them back into (A−λI)v=0 to find the corresponding eigenvectors.

Importance in Machine Learning
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are critical in many ML concepts:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA finds the directions of maximum variance in the data. These directions are the eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. The corresponding eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance captured by each principal component. The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the most important principal component.

Spectral Clustering: This clustering technique uses the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix (or graph Laplacian) to find the best way to partition data into clusters.

Matrix Decomposition: Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are closely related to eigenvalue decomposition. SVD is used extensively in recommendation systems and dimensionality reduction.

Understanding Deep Learning: Eigenvalues can be used to analyze the Hessian matrix of a neural network's loss function to understand the curvature of the loss landscape, which gives insights into model training and generalization.
