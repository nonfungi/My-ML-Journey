# Chapter 1: Linear Algebra

## Section 1: Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors

Here I'll note down the core concepts of this section.

### 1. Scalar
A **scalar** is just a single number. It has no direction, only magnitude.
- *Examples:* The speed of a car (120 km/h), the temperature (25Â°C).

### 2. Vector
A **vector** is an array of numbers. Vectors have both **magnitude** and **direction**.
- *Example:* The force applied to an object.
- *Mathematical Notation:* $v = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$

### 3. Matrix
A **matrix** is a 2D array of numbers with rows and columns. You can think of it as a list of vectors.
- *Mathematical Notation:*
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
$$

### 4. Tensor
A **tensor** is a generalization of the previous concepts to higher dimensions.
- **Scalar:** A rank-0 tensor (0D)
- **Vector:** A rank-1 tensor (1D)
- **Matrix:** A rank-2 tensor (2D)
- **Rank-3 Tensor:** A 3D array (like a cube of numbers).
