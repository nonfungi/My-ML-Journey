### Key Advice for the Journey

* **Projects over everything:** The best way to learn is by doing. I will apply my knowledge to real-world datasets from platforms like Kaggle.
* **Balance theory and practice:** I will not just copy code; I will strive to understand the math and concepts behind the algorithms.
* **Consistency over intensity:** Daily, focused learning is more effective than infrequent, long study sessions.
