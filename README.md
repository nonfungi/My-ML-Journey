Welcome to my personal ML repository!

This space is dedicated to tracking my learning progress, documenting my projects, and sharing notes as I follow my goal of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, with a special focus on applying AI in the Web3 and security space.

### My Detailed Plan
I have a structured plan to guide my studies. You can view the full, step-by-step plan here:

As I complete each stage of the roadmap, I will add my projects and notes to this repository. Stay tuned!
